# BC03-PasswordGenerator

This site features a password generator I created with JavaScript. It uses a series of prompts and alerts to guide the user through entering valid password parameters. It then generates a password that fits those constraints using random number generation. Lastly, it provides the result to the user by writing to an HTML element in the page. The process can be repeated if the user would like multiple passwords generated with the same or different parameters.

# Usage

This repository is clearly useful for creating unique, strong passwords for a variety of constraints. Many users on the internet would benefit from this tool to improve the security of their accounts. If - like me - you find coming up with new passwords for each website to be tedious and time-consuming, this is the tool for you.
